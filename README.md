# AI-Based Beach Surveillance System

## 🌊 Overview
The AI-Based Beach Surveillance System is designed to monitor public beaches using live video feeds and AI. The system ensures safety by detecting people crossing predefined boundaries (like a sea or danger zone) and sending real-time alerts to prevent potential dangers.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Real-Time Video Monitoring**: Tracks people on the beach and their proximity to the danger zones.
- **Boundary Detection**: Uses AI models to detect if people cross safety limits.
- **Alerts**: Automatically sends email alerts when a person enters the danger zone.
- **User Interface**: A simple web-based interface to start and stop monitoring.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Models**: YOLOv8 for object detection
- **Other Tools**: OpenCV for video processing, SMTP for sending alerts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Beach-Surveillance-System.git
cd AI-Beach-Surveillance-System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Email Alerts
Update the `alert_system.py` file with your email credentials:
- `sender_email`: Your email address
- `receiver_email`: The email to send alerts
- `password`: Your email password (or app password if using Gmail)

### 4. Run the Application
Start the Flask server:
```bash
python src/app.py
```
Access the web app at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🌟 How It Works
1. The system starts live monitoring using the `monitoring.py` script.
2. **Object Detection**: The YOLOv8 model detects people in the video feed.
3. **Boundary Monitoring**: The system tracks the position of detected people relative to the danger zone boundary.
4. **Alerts**: When someone crosses the boundary, the `alert_system.py` script sends an email alert.
